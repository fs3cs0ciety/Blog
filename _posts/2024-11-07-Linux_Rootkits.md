# 🐧 Linux Kernel Rootkits

Welcome to my deep dive into **Linux kernel rootkits**. This post is part of my series on kernel development and cybersecurity, where we’ll explore how rootkits work, the techniques they use, and methods for detection.

## 🔍 What is a Rootkit?

A rootkit is a collection of software tools designed to gain privileged access while concealing its presence. Kernel rootkits operate at the system's core, or kernel level, allowing them to have deep control over system operations.

### 🧩 Types of Rootkits

Rootkits generally fall into two main categories:

- **User-mode rootkits**: Operate in the user space and are easier to detect.
- **Kernel-mode rootkits**: Reside in the kernel space, making them more challenging to identify and remove.

> **Note:** Kernel rootkits are the most dangerous type because they can modify core system functions, intercepting calls at a fundamental level.

## ⚙️ How Kernel Rootkits Work

Kernel rootkits often employ techniques like **system call hooking** and **Direct Kernel Object Manipulation (DKOM)** to remain undetected.

### System Call Hooking

System call hooking allows rootkits to intercept system calls, effectively hiding files, processes, or network connections from security tools.

### Direct Kernel Object Manipulation (DKOM)

DKOM alters kernel data structures directly, making it highly effective for stealth. By modifying kernel objects, DKOM-based rootkits can remain hidden without the need for conventional hooking.

## 🛠 Techniques for Detecting Rootkits

Despite their stealth, certain techniques can help detect kernel rootkits:

1. **Integrity Checking**: Regularly verify the integrity of kernel code and data.
2. **Behavioral Analysis**: Monitor for unusual system behavior, like hidden processes, network connections, or unexpected kernel modifications.
3. **Memory Scanning**: Scan memory for suspicious code that bypasses kernel defenses.

> **Tip:** Tools like `rkhunter` and `chkrootkit` can help identify known rootkits on Linux systems.

## 👨‍💻 Code Example: Basic Detection Check

Here’s a simple example in C that uses `ptrace` to check for a debugger, a technique often employed by rootkits:

```c
#include <sys/ptrace.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void check_debugger() {
    if (ptrace(PTRACE_TRACEME, 0, NULL, NULL) == -1) {
        printf("Debugger detected!\n");
        exit(1);
    }
    printf("No debugger found.\n");
}
